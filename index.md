title: About Early Access

## Welcome!


The ForgeRock Identity Cloud is an identity and access management solution. It
can help you integrate authentication and authorization into your applications.

With the ForgeRock Identity Cloud, you can:
- Register and authenticate users into your applications.
- Set up and configure hosted login and registration pages.
- Configure password policy.
- Reset passwords and configure forgotten password workflows.
- Create users via the Admin Console (UI) or through our APIs.

We want your feedback so we can include more of the functionality that you need.

### Expectations
- You can influence features and product direction.
- You'll have direct access to product and engineering.
- You can provide feedback from within the app.


### Notes


We've created this site solely for testing. Do not use any apps created
here in production. In addition:

- Do *not* add real customer data.
- Do review our progress. Tell us what we did right (or wrong).
- Do expect hiccups in reliability and stability; this is early access, after
all.
- Do review our documentation. While we'll strive to keep our documentation up
to date, you can expect unannounced changes as our development progresses.

We may pause or stop the Early Access program at any time.

### Feedback

We'd appreciate your feedback. Tell us what works (and what does not work). We
can then create a product better suited to your needs.

- We encourage you to report what you like (as well as any bugs that you see) at
[ea.cloud@forgerock.com](mailto:ea.cloud@forgerock.com).
- You can also report your observations directly through the feedback icon in
the lower right corner of the apps that you create.
- Review our [changelog]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/).
- To receive email updates, tell us at [ea.cloud@forgerock.com](mailto:ea.cloud@forgerock.com).
