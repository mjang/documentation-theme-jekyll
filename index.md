### Welcome to the ForgeRock Identity Cloud Early Access Program! 


The ForgeRock Identity Cloud is an identity and access management service allowing developers to quickly and easily integrate authentication and identity management into their applications. 

We're working hard to build out the right features and collect early feedback from customers so we can integrate it into the system. 

Here's what to expect...

- You'll be able to directly influence features and product direction.

- You'll have direct access to product and engineering.

- You'll be able to provide direct feedback from within the app.


### Some things to note...

<br>


- We'll strive to keep documentation updated, but you can expect unannounced breaking changes as we develop quickly.

- We may stop or pause access to the Early Access releases at any point.

- You'll encounter bugs and there will be reliability and stability hiccups.

- The EA site is not meant to be used in production, but is for you to kick the tires and tell us what you think we did right (or more likely what we did wrong)

- Keep up to date with [the latest changes]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/).
