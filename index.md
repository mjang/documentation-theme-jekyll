## Welcome

With the ForgeRock Identity Cloud, you can:
- Register and authenticate users into your applications.
- Set up and configure hosted login and registration pages.
- Configure password policy.
- Reset passwords and configure forgotten password workflows.
- Create users via the Admin Console (UI) or through our APIs.


We want your feedback so we can include more of the functionality that you need. Sign up at [www.forgerock.com/idaas](https://www.forgerock.com/idaas).

### Expectations
- You can influence features and product direction.
- You'll have direct access to product and engineering.
- You can provide feedback from within the app through the Intercom icon in the lower-right corner of the app.

### Notes

{% include note.html content="This is my note." %}

{% include tip.html content="This is my tip." %}

{% include warning.html content="This is my warning." %}

{% include important.html content="This is my important info." %}



The concept of a <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.scope}}">scope</a> is important.



We've created this site solely for testing. Do not use any apps created
here in production. In addition:

- Do *not* add real customer data.
- Do review our progress. Tell us what we did right (or wrong).
- Do expect hiccups in reliability and stability; this is early access, after
all.
- Do review our documentation. While we'll strive to keep our documentation up
to date, you can expect unannounced changes as our development progresses.
