#### Creating a Web App

You run an eCommerce site and you want to ask customers to register and login to your site so they can shop for goods. In this tutorial you will create a web app and integrate authorization using ForgeRock hosted pages and the [authorization code flow]({{ site.baseurl }}/overview/applications/#web) flow.

1. To get started follow the instructions on [setting up a web app]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdks/nodejs) using the node.js SDK.

1. In the admin console try adjusting the hosted pages by adding your own logo to see how you can configure the registration and login experience. 

1. Now try using the [Authentication APIs]({{ site.baseurl }}/apis/apis) to use your own login and registration pages instead of the hosted pages.
