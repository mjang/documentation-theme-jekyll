The ForgeRock architecture uses a 'shared nothing' approach. Under an organization separate tenants house users, devices and applications, APIs, permissions, meta data etc. These tenants are COMPLETELY isolated from the other. During stage one of early access you will only have one tenant. Keep up to date with [the latest changes]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/) for architecture updates.
