You have several choices when integrating your app into the platform. The method of integration depends on the kind of app you have and how users interact with it.

ForgeRock uses OAuth 2.0 to authorize access to protected resources and OpenID Connect to provide an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. This allows clients (apps) to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
