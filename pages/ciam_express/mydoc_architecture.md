A foundation of the ForgeRock architecture is its “shared nothing” approach that dramatically improves security. Your subscription comprises a sealed, self-sufficient environment containing dedicated computing, networking, and storage resources.

The ForgeRock software in your subscription is dedicated to you and you alone, and your sensitive data is housed only within your subscription – even ForgeRock itself can’t access it without your approval.

During stage one of early access you will only have one tenant, but in the future you will be able to set up multiple tenants. Keep up to date with [the latest changes](my_doc_release_notes_10) for architecture updates.
